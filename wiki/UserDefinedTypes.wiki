= User Defined Types =

A user defined type must implement the interface com.twolattes.json.types.Type

{{{
public interface Type<T> {
  public Class<T> getReturnedClass();
  public Object marshall(T entity);
  public T unmarshall(Object object);
}
}}}

The `getReturnedClass` return the `Class` object which represents the type `T`. The marshall and unmarshall methods take care of marshalling and unmarshalling.

To write your own, look at the `URLType` as an example.
